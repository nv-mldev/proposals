  \frametitle{Layer Functionalities - Part 1}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{UI Layer}: Provides the user interface for document upload, agent triggering, task management, version review, change history, and analytics dashboards. Interfaces with API layer for all interactions.
    \item \textbf{API Layer}: Acts as the central access point via ingress and API gateway. Handles routing, authentication, rate limiting, versioned API groups (auth, agent, document, ETL, ERP, summary, compliance).
    \item \textbf{ERP Task Engine Layer}: Manages projects, tasks, workflows, approvals, assignments. Acts as the orchestrator connecting ETL, AI, and document systems with user workflows and audit logs.
    \item \item \textbf{AI Agent Layer}: Executes intelligent agents for document generation, compliance review, email understanding, P\&ID parsing, semantic diffing, enquiry processing, and task summaries.
    \item \textbf{ETL \& Digitisation Layer}: Ingests and watches file systems and document uploads. Computes checksums, extracts metadata, invokes AI-based content extraction, and stores structured outputs.
    \item \textbf{Document System Layer}: Manages file uploads, versioning, semantic diffing, review flows, and links documents to tasks. Interfaces with storage and audit layers.
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AI Agent Layer}: Executes intelligent agents for document generation, compliance review, email understanding, P\&ID parsing, semantic diffing, enquiry processing, and task summaries.
    \item \textbf{ETL \& Digitisation Layer}: Ingests and watches file systems and document uploads. Computes checksums, extracts metadata, invokes AI-based content extraction, and stores structured outputs.
    \item \textbf{Document System Layer}: Manages file uploads, versioning, semantic diffing, review flows, and links documents to tasks. Interfaces with storage and audit layers.
    \item \textbf{Storage Layer}: Handles object storage (MinIO/S3), metadata (MongoDB/Postgres), embeddings (vector DB), audit trails (TimescaleDB), and raw file lifecycle APIs.
    \item \textbf{Observability Layer}: Collects metrics (Prometheus), logs (Loki/ELK), distributed traces (Jaeger), alerting (Alertmanager), and agent audit logs. Visualized via Grafana.
    \item \textbf{Infrastructure Layer}: Provides the platform base using Kubernetes, Vault, Prometheus, MinIO, SQL/NoSQL DBs, service mesh, ingress, and network/security policies.
  \end{itemize}
